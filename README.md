i have an issue with the restframework. it does not display the objects from postgresql databse that are present there.i have no idea why this is happening.
i am a beginner.the objects from model shop should be displayed in view shoplist using shopserializer.what am i suppose to do to solve this?
the url to this is categories/1/1/shops/.
